System tests allow you to test user interactions with your application, running tests in either a real or a headless browser. 
System tests use Capybara under the hood.

The take_screenshot helper method can be included anywhere in your tests to take a screenshot of the browser.

class ArticlesTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  test "viewing the index" do
    visit articles_path
    click_on "New Article"
    assert_selector "h1", text: "Articles"
  end
end

========================
Integration tests are used to test how various parts of our application interact. 
They are generally used to test important workflows within our application.

class BlogFlowTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "can see the welcome page" do
    get "/"
    assert_select "h1", "Welcome#index"
  end
end
